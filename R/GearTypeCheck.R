#' GearTypeCheck
#' This function checks whether the distance traveled by the sensor during the
#' profile is appropriate for the type of gear deployed by the vessel. Distance
#' traveled is calculated between the first and last data locations.
#' Theoretically, fixed gear should not move very far from where it is deployed.
#' However, mobile gear should move a minimum distance (which will be fishery
#' dependent). For example, tows by draggers targeting groundfish may be
#' hundreds of meters while tows with hydraulic clam dredges may only be tens of
#' meters.
#' @param dataframe a dataframe with at least the following columns TIMESTAMP,
#' LAT, LON. TIMESTAMP should be formatted as yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS. LAT and LON
#' should be in decimal degrees. Each data frame must have at least two rows of data.
#' @param gearType a 2016 ISSCFG Gear Code or abbreviation (full list here: https://www.fao.org/3/bt988e/bt988e.pdf) There is no default value.
#' @param buffer a single numeric value representing the acceptable movement
#' distance (m) based on the  gear type. Eventually, each gear type should have
#' a programmed value that can be overridden by the user. For now, the user must
#' specify the value in most cases. It is important to note that for fixed
#' gears, the function will check if movement > buffer, and for mobile gears the
#' function will check if movement <= buffer.

#' @returns Returns a TRUE/FALSE value with "TRUE" indicating that the gear has
#' moved in an unexpected way
#' @examples
#' GearTypeCheck(
#'      startLon=-70.92033,
#'      startLat=41.63875,
#'      endLon=-66.92022,
#'      endLat=42.16915,
#'      gearType='GNS'
#'      )

  ## Calculate the distance traveled by the gear from start to finish.
  distance=geosphere::distHaversine(

  ## Finally, if all of the above conditions are met, run the test based on the
  ## gear type.
